# Shiny in Four Apps

---

### Shiny

Shiny is made in RStudio.

Start with the [docs](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

Or go to Zev Ross 40 (!) apps [tutorial](http://zevross.com/blog/2016/04/19/r-powered-web-applications-with-shiny-a-tutorial-and-cheat-sheet-with-40-example-apps/).

Or straight to God Himself:

---

### shiny01

A single `app.R` file containing your frontend (`ui`) and backend (`server`):

.pull-left[
  <img src="images/shiny01_code.png" style="width: 90%" />
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="images/shiny01_app.png" style="width: 85%" />
]
---

### shiny02

I recommend befriending the frontend (`ui`) first:

.pull-left[
  <img src="images/shiny02_code.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="images/shiny02_app.png" style="width: 95%" />
]

---

### shiny03

Once it becomes too much we go modular.

Backend (`server.R`) is where R does her thing.

`observeEvent()` of slider changing to re-render a plot:

.pull-left[
  <img src="images/shiny03_code1.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="images/shiny03_code2.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

---

### shiny04

.pull-left[
  Use `reactiveValues()` to keep the state of dynamic objects:
  
  <img src="images/shiny04_code1.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

.pull-right[
  Use `renderUI()` for dynamic UI:
  
  <img src="images/shiny04_code2.png" style="width: 100%" />
  
  <img src="images/shiny04_code3.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

# Dash in Four Apps

---

### Dash

Dash is made by Plotly, other than Python it works with R and Julia.

It is much "closer" to JavaScript (advantage?)

Start with the [docs](https://plotly.com/dash/).

Another promising option is [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) by Jupyter.

---

### dash01

A single `app.py` file containing your frontend (`layout`) and backend (`callbacks`):

.pull-left[
  <img src="images/dash01_code.png" style="width: 90%" />
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="images/dash01_app.png" style="width: 85%" />
]
---

### dash02

I recommend befriending the frontend (`layout`) first:

.pull-left[
  <img src="images/dash02_code.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="images/dash02_app.png" style="width: 95%" />
]

---

### dash03

Once it becomes too much we go modular.

Backend (`callbacks.py`) is where Python does her thing.

`@app.callback()` of slider changing to re-render a plot:

.pull-left[
  <img src="images/dash03_code1.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="images/dash03_code2.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

---

### dash04

.pull-left[
  There are no `reactiveValues` in Dash backend (AFAIK), but we can do multiple `Output`s/`Input`s and `State`s
  
  <img src="images/dash04_code1.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

.pull-right[
  And rendering UI is very easy because every object's components are modifiable:
  
  <img src="images/dash04_code2.png" style="width: 100%" />
  
  <img src="images/dash04_code3.png" style="width: 100%" />
]

### Summary

Do I think you can replace the Front-end engineer at your organization? No.

But you can certainly use data apps for:

* Inside dashboards (everyone can access via company server or with Docker: Vivian)
* Personal tools (RateImagesApp, Formulan)
* Quick prototypes
* Showing people in company how data/analysis looks like and letting them playing with it
* Simulations
* Model testing
