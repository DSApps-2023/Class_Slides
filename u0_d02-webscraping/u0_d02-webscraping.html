# The Three Rules of Web Scraping

---

### Rule 1: Do you *really* need web scraping?

There are data APIs for just about anything, you know...

&lt;img src="images/apis.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;

---

#### R API Packages

Many of them already accessible with a R/Python package...


```r
library(wbstats)

female_labor &lt;- wb_data(
  indicator = c("women_lab_share" = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS"),
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)

female_labor %&gt;%
  filter(country %in% c("Israel", "United States")) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(date, women_lab_share, color = country)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 2) +
  labs(title = "Share of women in labor force") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=16))
```

---

#### The `datapasta` package

My gift to you.

&lt;div class = "no_shadow"&gt;
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
    &lt;img class = "no_shadow" src="images/demo.jpg"/&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---


### Rule 2: Learn some HTML first!

HTML is a set (or tree) of *elements*, marked by *HTML tags*:

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="images/html1.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/webpage1.png" style="width: 95%" /&gt;
]

- First children in the tree: `header` and `body`
- View any page's HTML (on chrome) with right-click and "View page source" (or Ctrl + U)

---

#### Useful elements and attributes to know

- `&lt;p&gt;` for paragraph `&lt;/p&gt;`
- `&lt;h1&gt;` for headings `&lt;/h1&gt;`
- `&lt;br&gt;`, `&lt;hr&gt;` for breaks
- `&lt;a href = "http://www.google.com&gt;` for links `&lt;/a&gt;`
- `&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;` For bold, italic etc. `&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;`
- `&lt;img src="img_name.jpg" alt="Alternative text"&gt;`
- `&lt;p style="color:DodgerBlue;"&gt;` for font color `&lt;/p&gt;`

---

#### HTML Tables

A big thing when it comes to data as you can imagine...

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="images/html2.png" style="width: 60%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/webpage2.png" style="width: 120%" /&gt;
]

---

#### HTML Classes

A class attribute is defined in a style sheet, lets you repeat a style.

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="images/html3.png" style="width: 80%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/webpage3.png" style="width: 120%" /&gt;
]

---

### Rule 3: Be polite!

With great power comes great responsibility.

See e.g. the [polite](https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/) package.

### `read_html()`

You're now a NLP expert, and you've just developed a SOTA Q&amp;A model. How would you demonstrate your model's performance?

How about [triviaquestionsnow.com](https://www.triviaquestionsnow.com/)?

Let's scrape a few Q&amp;As. Politely.


```r
library(rvest)

url &lt;- "https://www.triviaquestionsnow.com/for/sports-trivia"

html_obj &lt;- read_html(url)
```

`read_html()` is usually where you'd start. What did you get?


```r
class(html_obj)
```

```
## [1] "xml_document" "xml_node"
```

---

### View page source

With time, you'll become friendly with this weird object. Right now it is better than...

&lt;img src="images/view_page_source.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;

---

### `html_children()` and `html_node()`

Our tree has two children: `head` and `body`


```r
html_obj %&gt;% html_children()
```

```
## {xml_nodeset (2)}
## [1] &lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...
## [2] &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div class="title-bar" data-responsive-toggle="nav" data-hide ...
```

Again notice the object returned might not be familiar ("`xml_nodeset`")

And each of the children has children of its own:


```r
html_obj %&gt;% html_node("body") %&gt;% html_children()
```

```
## {xml_nodeset (6)}
## [1] &lt;div class="title-bar" data-responsive-toggle="nav" data-hide-for="medium ...
## [2] &lt;div id="nav" class="top-bar"&gt;\n        &lt;div class="row"&gt;\n            &lt;d ...
## [3] &lt;div class="wrap bg-grey-light t-pad-20 b-pad-20"&gt;\n            &lt;div clas ...
## [4] &lt;script src="https://www.triviaquestionsnow.com/js/all.js?v=1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
## [5] &lt;script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-1150690 ...
## [6] &lt;script&gt;\n        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n        fun ...
```

---

### `html_nodes()`

Usually we'd figure out a rule and want a list of all relevant nodes:


```r
html_obj %&gt;% html_nodes("img")
```

```
## {xml_nodeset (8)}
## [1] &lt;img src="https://www.triviaquestionsnow.com/img/trivia-questions.png" al ...

### `html_attrs()`

Getting a specific attribute from those nodes:


```r
html_obj %&gt;% html_nodes("img") %&gt;% html_attr("src")
```

```
## [1] "https://www.triviaquestionsnow.com/img/trivia-questions.png"                               
## [2] "https://www.triviaquestionsnow.com/img/trivia-questions.png"

### How to get to those questions? Option 1

Look at the page source, get some identifier yourself (class, ID, link)

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="images/question.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/question_html.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;
]


```r
 html_obj %&gt;% html_nodes(".question") %&gt;% .[[1]]
```

```
## {html_node}
## &lt;div class="question callout" ng-controller="QuestionController as question"&gt;

# BeautifulSoup

---

### Almost always start with


```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_obj = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Real_Housewives_cast_members')

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_obj.content, 'html.parser')
type(soup)
```

```
## &lt;class 'bs4.BeautifulSoup'&gt;
```

This object has all sorts of attributes and methods:


```python
soup.get_text()
soup.prettify()
soup.attrs
soup.children
soup.title
```

---

### `find()` a tag, `find_all()`


```python
link_objs = soup.find_all('a', href=True)
type(link_objs)
```

```
## &lt;class 'bs4.element.ResultSet'&gt;
```

```python
type(link_objs[3])
```

```
## &lt;class 'bs4.element.Tag'&gt;
```

```python
link_objs[3].text
```

```
## 'media franchise'
```

```python
link_objs[3].attrs
```

```
## {'href': '/wiki/Media_franchise', 'title': 'Media franchise'}
```

See the actual link in the [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Real_Housewives_cast_members).

---

### Getting that `table`


```python
table = soup.find('table', attrs={'class':'wikitable'})
table_body = table.find('tbody')

rows = table_body.find_all('tr')
print(len(rows))
```

```
## 142
```

```python
print(rows[0])
```

```
## &lt;tr&gt;
## &lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;Installment
## &lt;/th&gt;
## &lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;Housewives
## &lt;/th&gt;
## &lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;First season&lt;br/&gt;starred
## &lt;/th&gt;
## &lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;Last season&lt;br/&gt;starred
## &lt;/th&gt;
## &lt;th colspan="3"&gt;Number of seasons
## &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
```

---

### Getting a Housewife name

&lt;img src="images/housewife_row_html.png" style="width: 100%" /&gt;


```python
import re

print(rows[3].find('span', attrs = {'data-sort-value': re.compile(r'.*')}))
```

```
## &lt;span data-sort-value="De La Rosa, Jo !"&gt;Jo De La Rosa&lt;/span&gt;
```

---

### Getting only HWives with Wiki pages


```python
housewives_with_links = []
for row in rows:
  housewife = row.find('span',
    attrs = {'data-sort-value': re.compile(r'.*')})
  if housewife is not None:
    link = housewife.find('a')
    if link is not None:
      housewives_with_links.append((housewife.text, link['href']))

import pandas as pd

h_df = pd.DataFrame(housewives_with_links, columns=['name', 'link'])

h_df.head()
```

```
##                     name                         link
## 0        Vicki Gunvalson        /wiki/Vicki_Gunvalson
## 1           Jeana Keough           /wiki/Jeana_Keough
## 2         Heather Dubrow         /wiki/Heather_Dubrow
## 3  Shannon Storms Beador  /wiki/Shannon_Storms_Beador
## 4       Bethenny Frankel       /wiki/Bethenny_Frankel
```

---

### (Though if your table is simple, try:)


```python
l = pd.read_html(html_obj.text)

l[0].head()
```

```
##      Installment       Housewives  ... Number of seasons      
##      Installment       Housewives  ...            Friend Guest
## 0  Orange County  Kimberly Bryant  ...               0.0   3.0
## 1  Orange County    Jo De La Rosa  ...               0.0   2.0
## 2  Orange County  Vicki Gunvalson  ...               1.0   0.0
## 3  Orange County     Jeana Keough  ...               1.0   4.0
## 4  Orange County   Lauri Peterson  ...               1.0   1.0
## 
## [5 rows x 7 columns]
```

### Following HWives Links


```python
def get_housewife_img_ref(housewife_link):
  html_obj = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org' + housewife_link)
  soup = BeautifulSoup(html_obj.content, 'html.parser')
  infobox = soup.find('table', attrs = {'class': 'vcard'})
  if infobox is not None:
    img_obj = infobox.find('img', src=True)
    if img_obj is not None:
      return img_obj['src']
  return None
  
h_df['img_ref'] = h_df['link'].apply(get_housewife_img_ref)
h_df.dropna(inplace=True)

h_df.head()
```


```
##                       name  ...                                            img_ref
## 0          Vicki Gunvalson  ...  //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb...
## 1         Luann de Lesseps  ...  //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb...

### Downloading HWives Images


```python
def make_img_filename(hf_name):
  return 'data/housewives/' + hf_name.lower().strip(',.-').replace(' ', '_') + '.jpg'

def download_hw_img(hf_name, hf_img_ref):
  img_file = make_img_filename(hf_name)
  img_data = requests.get('http:' + hf_img_ref).content
  with open(img_file, 'wb') as handler:
      handler.write(img_data)
      
h_df.apply(lambda row: download_hw_img(row['name'], row['img_ref']),
  axis=1)
```
